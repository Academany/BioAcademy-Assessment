# Bio Academy Assignments and Assessment

*Created by Anna Kaziunas France, Bas Withagen and Jean-michel Molenaar*  

 During Bio Academy, you will learn how to envision, prototype and document your ideas through many hours of hands-on experience with digital fabrication tools. This document outlines:

* The assignments (what you’ll do),

* What we want you to learn each week (why you’re doing it)

* The base-line evidence/proof/things you need to show what you’ve learnt each week (what you did and how you did it).

As you work, check the information for each assignment in this document. Advise your local instructor when you’ve completed assignments so they include your work in their weekly round of assessment. Your local instructor will advise of dates and times of assessments.
