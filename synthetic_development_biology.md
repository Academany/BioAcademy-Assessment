# Synthetic development biology

### The lab assignment is to build a Paramecium/Arduino interface.

In order for students to pass the course, they must obtain a video of paramecia (a) swim and (b) change direction in response to electrical stimulation.   

Even though the setup may be constructed of a variety of components that may either be bought (i.e. microscope), hacked (i.e. webcam) or DIY’ed, the paramecia must be filmed (1) alive, and (2) responsive to the applied voltage.   

Of course, this is just the beginning - students may choose to film the paramecia “dancing” to music, incorporate them into a gaming interface, create a race or maze, or let their imaginations run wild in other ways!
