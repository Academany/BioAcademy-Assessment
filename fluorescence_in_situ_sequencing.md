# FISSEQ

Although the complexity and expense of biological measurement technologies continues to fall, this homework may still be quite challenging. The assignment is comprised of several aspects:

* Experimental design
* Computational analysis
* Bench “wet” work
* Please attempt to complete all three aspects!

For the bench work, I appreciate that this may be very challenging in a DIY space, so the bench work contains several versions of the homework that vary in difficulty. Please work towards the increasingly challenging homework until you reach the limits of your facility.

If challenges may arise the computational aspects, such as poor documentation, bugs, version incompatibilities, and hardware limitations, please use the resources available on the Internet to help you. Stack Overflow is a great resource for advice on programming, and a quick Google search is always a good first line of inquiry.

As the price of DNA sequencing continues to fall and the Bio Academy continues to grow, we anticipate that HTGAA participants will be able to conduct simple genome sequencing experiments within a few years! Your effort and feedback with this project are crucial to help us understand what is feasible in a DIY Bio space!

#### Grading

To be considered “​passing”​ this assignment, please complete ​the following tasks:

* Group discussion about the Experimental Design questions.
* Individual or group written answers to all four Experimental Design questions (note which people contributed to each submission). See guidelines for answering in that section.
* Go through the entire Introduction to Image Processing Assignment tutorial.
* Identify the nuclei of this FISSEQ image using the tools from the tutorial.
* Go through the entire Introduction to Bioinformatics tutorial (show the phylogenetic tree output from the final step).
* Use Biopython to convert a DNA sequencing into the corresponding RNA and protein sequence (for help see the Bio.Seq module).
* Read the Experimental Assignments section.
