# Bio Fabrication and Additive Manufacturing

1.	Regeneration of silk fibroin into an aqueous suspension (please, refer to Step 1-23 in Rockwood et al. Nature Protocols, 6, 1612–1631 (2011) in background reading).

2.	Fabrication of an edible, implantable, biodegradable diffraction grating through soft lithography (please, refer to Step 25H in Rockwood et al. Nature Protocols, 6, 1612–1631 (2011) in background reading).

3. Superfab Assignment - Biomanufacturing in 3D Using the silk suspension obtained in Assignment #1 in combination with a XYZ dispensing system for the 3D printing of silk fibroin

Edit
Reagents
Aside from standard laboratory equipment such us personal protection garments, hot plates, spatula, etc. the following materials are required:

Extraction of silk fibroin

* Delipided and pre-washed silk cocoons (prepackaged, shipped to you by Silklab)
* Sodium carbonate (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 451614, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/)
* Ultrapure water
* Lithium bromide (LiBr, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 213225, http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/)
